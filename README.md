# The Program
	
Shape Calculator is a small terminal based program
that works out the various measurements of shapes
based on dimensions provided to it by the user.

For example by providing it with the length of a single
side of a square, it can provide the user with the square's
area and circumference. And in the case of a cube, it can also
provide the cube's volume.

# End Goal

The end goal for this project is to have a program 
that can calculate dimensions for the following shapes:

	2D:
			circle        [DONE]
			square        [DONE]
			rectangle     [IN_PROGRESS]
			triangle      [NOT_DONE]
			trapezium     [NOT_DONE]
			parallelogram [NOT_DONE]

	3D:
			cube          [NOT_DONE]
			sphere        [NOT_DONE]
			cylinder      [NOT_DONE]
			cuboid        [NOT_DONE]
